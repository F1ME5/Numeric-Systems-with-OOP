# Numeric-Systems-with-OOP
A remade version of my project https://github.com/FimesX/Numeric-Systems using OOP and improving functions tasks.

I divided mi old Main.py in three modules so the organization is more readable.
I wrote the code even cleaner than the old version so I hope you undetstand each single line.

That's all. I hope you like my work, feel free to ask anything you want and use this program as you want.
